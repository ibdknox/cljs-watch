# CLJS watcher

A simple shell script that watches for changes to CLJS files and recompiles them for you.

## Usage

You must have ClojureScript already setup and have $CLOJURESCRIPT_HOME correctly set. 

Put `cljs-watch` on your $PATH (such as in /usr/local/bin) and then simply run it from your project root:

```bash
#without options it watches the src/ directory
cljs-watch

#it can also take a directory and compile options
cljs-watch cljs-src/ '{:optimizations :none :output-to "test.js"}'
```

## Notes
* the default output-to is set to `resources/public/cljs/bootstrap.js`
* it will add the local `lib/` to your classpath when you run it, allowing you to have other cljs deps in that folder
* to add custom macros, you can use create a folder called `cljs-macros/` from the root directory and add your macros there. You can also put macros in `CLOJURESCRIPT_HOME/lib/` to have them globally available.
* `:optimizations` is set to `:simple` by default. you can disable any optimization by passing `:none` as the value.
